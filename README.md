## What is this all about?

> Tic-tac-toe (also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. Players soon discover that best play from both parties leads to a draw. Hence, Tic-tac-toe is most often played by young children.

First of all, I made a tic tac toe game for two players, it was a piece of cake. My goal is to create a "thinking" game, even if it makes a random choice it is okay. 

My game has 3 levels difficulty plus for two players.
